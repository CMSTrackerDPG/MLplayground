# Lumisections

The lumisections app is meant to encapsulate information relative to each lumisection. The main external source of information is the OMS website.

## Filling the database

The creation of a lumisection can be triggered in several ways. The current approach based on the ML4DQM effort is to extract all the lumisections while adding histograms. Lumisections are created with minimal information. Some information (ZeroBias rate, ...) is then asynchroneously added using the OMS API.
