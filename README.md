# DQM Playground

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/XavierAtCERN/MLplayground.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/XavierAtCERN/MLplayground)

The goal of the DQM Playground is to serve information from various sources (OMS, Run Registry, DQM GUI, static files from the ML4DQM effort) in order to ease model development and to provide a place to compare the predictions of the various models.
